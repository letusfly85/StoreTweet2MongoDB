gem install oauth
gem install inifile
gem install mongodb

These scripts store tweets from the 'Twitter Stream API' to the MongoDB.

I use gem 'net/http' and get streams below.
https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/sample.json
https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json

Especially, for below stream I use a hash table which have keywords to the track attribute.
https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json

If you want to use a proxy server, you had to write down the file '.property'.
Otherwise, scripts don't use any proxy servers.

Now I'm coding.
